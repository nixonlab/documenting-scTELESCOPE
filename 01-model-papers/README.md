# Bioinformatics tools examples # 

This directory is dedicated to example papers that can be relevant for our scTELESCOPE paper 

## Goals ##

- Pre-determine which journal we wish to target
- Decide which sections we want in the paper
- Understand the standard for bioinformatics papers introducing a tool

## Papers ##

- These two papers are specific pipelines to analyse TEs in single-cell data:
  - [Identifying transposable element expression dynamics and heterogeneity during development at the single-cell level with a processing pipeline scTE](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21808-x)
    - March 2021
    - They only reach family level
    - [Notes](scTE_2021.md)
