# Single-Cell RNA-seq Datasets #

This is a list of papers and datasets that are interesting. We will select datasets to analyse depending on our goals and those will be described in a dedicated spreadsheet.

## Collections of datasets ##

- [HCA Project Catalogue](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/humancellatlas/project-catalogue/)."A comprehensive list of cellular resolution datasets for the Human Cell Atlas"


## 10x genomics datasets ##

- [10k PBMCs from a Healthy Donor (v3 chemistry)](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/3.0.0/pbmc_10k_v3)

- [1k PBMCs from a Healthy Donor (v3 chemistry)](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/3.0.0/pbmc_1k_v3)


## Papers with biologically-interesting data ##

- GTEx samples but now there's single-cell RNA-seq data: [Single-nucleus cross-tissue molecular reference maps to decipher disease gene function](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.19.452954v1.full). This could be the equivalent of the ENCODE data that was analyzed in the original TELESCOPE paper

- [Single-cell analysis of germinal-center B cells informs on lymphoma cell of origin and outcome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7537389/). 
  - [Transcriptional profiles of human mature B cells from tonsil tissue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE139833)
  - [Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of human germinal center B cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE139891)

- [Landscape of stimulation-responsive chromatin across diverse human immune cells](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0505-9#data-availability)

- [Integrated single cell and bulk gene expression and ATAC-seq reveals heterogeneity and early changes in pathways associated with resistance to cetuximab in HNSCC sensitive cell lines (scRNA-Seq)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE137524)

- [AP-2alpha-mediated activation of E2F and EZH2 drives melanoma metastasis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE162362)

- [Single-cell multi-omics analysis of the immune response in COVID-19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01329-2#data-availability). IS the raw data available?. In this work they use azimuth(mapping to a reference)

## Bioinformatics/technical papers ##
