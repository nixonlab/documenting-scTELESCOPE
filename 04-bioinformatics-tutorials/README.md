# Tutorials #

This is a set of useful tutorials and resources to check out and/or work on before the Hackathon in September.

Take a look at them, some are really short!

## Single-Cell RNA-sequencing  ##

- There is a paper called ["Tutorial: guidelines for the computational analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-00409-w), it was born from a course-tutorial, which is available [here](https://www.singlecellcourse.org/introduction-to-single-cell-rna-seq.html). It includes basic information about single-cell protocols and a brief description of what to do with the raw data, because it's mostly focused on downstream analysis.

- There are two main paradigms in single-cell sequencing:
  - 1: full length (e.g. SMART). See [here](https://data.humancellatlas.org/pipelines/smart-seq2-workflow) the Human Cell Atlas data processing pipeline.
    - More genes, fewer cells.
    - These methods don't support UMIs (only SMART-seq3 does).
    - You can detect splice variants.
    - You get to sequence variable regions of genes beyond the extremes (this is relevant for e.g. T and B cell receptors).
    - People are meant to use this methods to "study a smaller group of cells in greater detail". So if you know a surface marker is specific for your cells of interest, you'd do well to sort them and use full-length methods to study them.
  - 2: tag-based (e.g. 10x). See [here](https://data.humancellatlas.org/pipelines/optimus-workflow) the Human Cell Atlas data processing pipeline.
    - More cells, fewer genes.
    - Use cellular barcodes (short nucleotide tags attached to each read that are unique to a droplet/well) to identify each transcript's cell of origin.
    - Supports UMIs (short barcodes attached to transcripts before amplification). This helps with removing PCR duplicates and improving accuracy of expression levels estimates.
    - You only sequence the 5' or 3' end of each mRNA.

## Documentation tools ##

- [Mastering markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [Sphinx](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html) is a documentation generator that has many features for writing technical documentation. You've probably seen software or bioinformatics tools documentation hosted in [read the docs](https://readthedocs.org/). Sphinx is how you create it.

## Modern coding practices ##

- [Git tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial). Git is software (most likely experienced as a set of commands) to keep track of changes in a set of files (You can look at it as a wet lab logbook). It was created by Linus Torvalds (I mean, how many useful things can that guy create?). Anyway, learn how to use these and you're probably good:
  - `git init` to start a fresh git repository
  - `git add` to add or stage changes you've made to your repository
  - `git commit -m "commit message e.g. create script to plot volcano plot"` once you've made a set of related changes you want to commit them to safety or 'snapshot' your changes to the repository timeline (meaning, they'll live on forever)
  - You can use `git diff` to compare changes you've made against the current snapshot of the repository

Now, Git is really helpful to work as a team in coding projects because many people can work simultaneously on the same things. Meaning, we can use something like [GitHub](https://github.com), which is an internet service that hosts git repositories, to store our projects and work on them.


- Workflow management is a way to code analysis pipelines with order and reproducibility. See [this review](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/18/3/530/2562749) if you're like really interested. Focus on snakemake. [Here's](https://vincebuffalo.com/blog/2020/03/04/understanding-snakemake.html) a good explanation/tutorial of what it is and what it does.
  - [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is software that's python-based and it lets you do build automation. "Its implicit intention is to automate command line data processing tasks, such as those common in bioinformatics"
  - It's inspired in MAKE. A software tool and language from 1976 that takes advantage of a simple idea: **If we declare what files depende on other files, we only need to run the steps downstream of the files that have changed**. Therefore, the rules are only run if (1) the input files changed, (2) the target of the rule does not exist and needs to be created.
  - Basically you declare what needs to be done (rules), and make/snakemake execute things in the right order.
  - There are many snakemake functions, but start with the very basic things. [This tutorial](https://slides.com/johanneskoester/snakemake-tutorial) (made by the person who develops snakemake) is useful because it starts simple, and describes everything about snakemake. 

  

## single-cell analysis DOWNSTREAM of scTELESCOPE ##  

We want people to actually use scTELESCOPE and that means we need to consider "what do people do with single-cell RNA-seq data?"

Well, after aligning reads to the genome, peple use [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/) to QC, analyse and explore the single-cell RNA-seq data. So we really need to know what happens within Seurat, which data does it take as input and in which formats. 

So check out [Getting started with Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/get_started.html).
