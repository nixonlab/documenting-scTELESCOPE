# NCBI style hackathon #

There are competitive hackathons (many groups work to try and find the best solution for a problem and compete for a prize), but NCBI hackathons are not competitive, they are collaborative. 

"Participants work in small collaborative groups on workflows, scripts or applications to create bioinformatic solutions to problems".

- Software in alpha/beta state
- 3-day hackathons
- [Teams of 5-6 individuals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13mfq3iMZMrFSu3chMFqBUlhz47VcSt93GlCUrJsRDEQ/edit) who typically don't know each other work to build a project with a novel functionality
- Every team works on something different and has a goal
- Use [OSF home](https://osf.io/) to generate [DOIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) (even if the results are not published) 

Hackathons can have a larger impact on the scientific community. According to NCBI the goals of a hackathon are (1) production, (2) education, (3) networking.

- NCBI has helped others with their hackathons
- They have a network of Hackathon alumni in LinkedIn
- It seems like they grew progressively and by the time they made [their video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoqwWuWi12w) they had become interested in
  - professional grade software (data science and computer science standards)
  - project management/product management
  - machine learning projects
- Before, they were doing solution-specific goals and using lots of encapsulation in their projects (docker, singularity, etc)

## Logistics and practical considerations ##

"There's a lot that goes into the planning and prepration"

- Project scope: is predifined. Select a project that will be feasible to do within the time range (if you select a project that's too big, people will struggle to get it done and may become frustrated).
- Make sure that you have a team lead for each of the problems or projects. They should provide leadership and subject matter expertise (typically  someone who has a little bit more experience)
  - It can be very useful if you have them suggest potential problems/projects at the planning stage.
- Resources and data need to be ready (you don't want to be in a situation where the data you need to test your solutions to the problem is not available).
- Make sure everybody is ready to go when the hackathon starts
  - Be aware of participant experience level and sill sets
  - Before the hackathon you should communicate to participants if people will be expected to e.g. code in R or Python or if they should have specific knowledge. This ensures that everybody is going to have a good experience.
- It's worth looking at what has already been done in this area (you don't want to realize haflway through that e.g. somebody's already built your tool)
- Consider needed support staff (to make sure that all the energy and enthusiasm is going towards the goals and not solving minor issues)
- Teams are not people who come together as a pre-formed team. They are put in a team based on their interests and expertise.
  - Diversity is key 
  - In their experience teams work better when they don't know each other

## Preparing the event ##

- Locatoin and spaces
  - Adequate power/wifi
- Food and coffee
  - If food is close, time is not wasted
  - Make sure people eat, they might try to skip it
- Channels of communication between participants (e.g. Slack channel)
  - Enable communication before the hackathon starts
  - Facilitate communication after the hackathon (e.g. to finish the manuscript)
- Code of conduct
  - Everyone should know the expectations about behavior and how to interact appropriately
  - An [example](https://confcodeofconduct.com/)

## During the hackathon ##

- Who handles troubleshooting? (e.g. support staff)
  - Their goal is to have participants work on the scientific problem and nothing else
- Keep energy up
  - Leaders can motivate people and keep them excited
- Be flexible with the problems you are working with and the approaches you are taking to solve them
  - If the originally thought plan in a team doesn't work, teams that succeed are usually the ones that try another approach
  - Sometimes people realize on the last day that what they are trying doesn't work
- [Document and write](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/Run_an_NCBI-style_hackathon/blob/master/outputs.md) (!!)
- Encourage networking  (it's a social/educational event too)

## Schedule ##

- [This is an example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S0WzRGUjmzvLLQRbQrKfgW5qKTEsna4KDFeoCRvL69Y/edit)
- The first thing the first day: teams should think about the project/goal and **before** writing any code plan how will they approach the problems: what steps will they take.
- Lunch/group presentations: useful because you get feedback daily
- Writers group breakout: each team has a designated writer who is the appointed person to do documentation. During their breakout sessions they get together and receive feedback from someone who can tell them how to edit, how to think about publishing, etc

## General things ##

- Open source everything (MIT Licence)
- Document everything (GitHub + e.g. blog posts + manuscripts)
  - NCBI has templates 
- Appropriate scoping (e.g. building something that requires a complicated backend and a complicated frontend is probably too much)
- Encourage people to learn something new (e.g. containers, workflow management, modern coding practices)
- Share with the world (e.g. your institution, twitter, librarians)
