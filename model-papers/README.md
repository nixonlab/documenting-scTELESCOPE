# Bioinformatics tools examples # 

This directory is dedicated to example papers that can be relevant for our scTELESCOPE paper 

## Goals ##

- Pre-determine which journal we wish to target
- Decide which sections we want in the paper
- Understand the standard for bioinformatics papers introducing a tool

## Papers ##
